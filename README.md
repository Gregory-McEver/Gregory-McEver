# Smokey Labs — Gregory “Smokey” McEver

**Forging resilient systems under real-world heat.**  
Awareness before automation. Authority before action.

I design governance-first architectures that treat AI as a **participant in accountability**, not a shortcut around it.

I am not interested in systems that move fast and explain later.  
I am interested in systems that know when to stop.

## 🔥 Flagship Project — AEGIS Protocol

**AEGIS (Authority Envelope Governance Interface Specification)** is a control-first framework for deploying AI into operational systems **without surrendering ownership of action**.

AEGIS is built around one premise:

> *AI must operate inside clearly defined authority boundaries, or refuse to act.*

AEGIS enforces:
- Evidence before execution  
- Explicit authority envelopes  
- Mandatory human-in-the-loop for irreversible actions  
- UNKNOWN propagation instead of fabricated certainty  
- Refusal-first behavior when authority or evidence is insufficient  
- Design vetoes to prevent architectural drift

## 🛡 Aurora Sentinel (Reference Implementation)

**Aurora** is the reference implementation of AEGIS.

She is not designed to be a chatty assistant.

Aurora operates primarily as a **Sentinel**:
- a passive, ambient presence
- continuously observing system conditions
- surfacing governance-relevant signals
- preserving evidence and uncertainty
- refusing to speculate or overreach

Aurora speaks **only when justified**.

## 🔎 Aurora Inquest (Explicit Inquiry Mode)

When explicitly invoked, Aurora may operate in **Inquest** mode:
- human-guided
- session-bound
- exploratory
- provisional by design

Inquest exists to illuminate the unknown —  
**never** to silently govern, enforce, or decide.

Aurora does not explore unless asked.  
Aurora does not govern while exploring.

## 🧱 Architectural Posture

- AEGIS runs on **Linux only** within a controlled shadow-zone  
- Windows and other systems are **observed**, not trusted as hosts  
- Evidence is ingested, normalized, and preserved under Linux-defined invariants  
- Platform convenience is rejected when it threatens determinism or auditability  

Some ideas are not deferred.  
They are **vetoed by design**.

## 🛠 What I’m Working On

- AEGIS Beta hardening (Signal Forge, evidence, replayability)
- Aurora Sentinel analytics and escalation semantics
- Drift detection and integrity-loss signaling
- Shadow-zone Git governance and audit trails
- Research on human accountability in AI-mediated systems

Design discussions, backlog reviews, and philosophical debates live here:

This is not a hype channel.  
It is a thinking space.

## 🧠 Design Belief

I am not building a hero system.  
I am building a **steward of process**.

One that will illuminate risk.  
One that will preserve truth.  
And one that will refuse you — calmly and correctly —  
when you step beyond what you can justify.
