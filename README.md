# Smokey Labs — Gregory “Smokey” McEver

**Forging resilient systems under real-world heat.**  
Awareness before automation. Authority before action.

I design governance-first architectures that treat AI as a *participant in accountability*, not a shortcut around it.

## 🔥 Flagship Project — AEGIS Protocol

**AEGIS (Authority Envelope Governance Interface Specification)** is a control-first framework for deploying AI into operational systems *without surrendering ownership of action.*

It enforces:
- Evidence before execution  
- Bounded authority envelopes  
- Mandatory human-in-the-loop for irreversible actions  
- UNKNOWN propagation instead of hallucinated certainty  
- Refusal-first posture when authority or evidence is insufficient

## 🌌 Aurora Watch

Aurora is the reference implementation of AEGIS — a safety-first, awareness-before-action operations system built for real infrastructure.

Philosophy:
> AI should elevate human judgment, not replace it.

## 🛠 What I’m Working On

- AEGIS Beta hardening
- Aurora regression harness + drift detection
- Shadow-zone Git governance model
- Research paper on human accountability in AI-mediated systems

## 🧠 Design Belief

I am not building a hero system.  
I am building a steward of process.

One that will refuse you — for your own sake — when you step beyond what you can justify.
